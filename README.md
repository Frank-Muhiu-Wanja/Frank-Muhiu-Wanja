# Hi there, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
Iâ€™m someone who enjoys turning ideas into real projects through code.  
Technology gives me the freedom to build, experiment, and bring imagination to life.  

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m passionate about creating, problem-solving, and always pushing myself to learn more.  
âœ¨ For me, coding is not just about writing lines of code â€” itâ€™s about creativity, curiosity, and growth.  

Here, youâ€™ll find some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on. Each one represents a step in my journey,  
and Iâ€™m excited to keep building more along the way.

to get the above stats:

  GitHub itself does not provide those stats cards or streak images.
  
  Developers in the community (like Anurag Hazra and DenverCoder1) built these tools as open-source projects.
  
  They use the GitHub API (which is official) to fetch your activity and then render it into nice SVG images.
  
  Because GitHub READMEs allow embedding images, you can just drop the generated links in your README and it works.
