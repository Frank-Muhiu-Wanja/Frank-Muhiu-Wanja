# Hi there, I'm Frank 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I’m someone who enjoys turning ideas into real projects through code.  
Technology gives me the freedom to build, experiment, and bring imagination to life.  

💻 I’m passionate about creating, problem-solving, and always pushing myself to learn more.  
✨ For me, coding is not just about writing lines of code — it’s about creativity, curiosity, and growth.  

Here, you’ll find some of the projects I’ve been working on. Each one represents a step in my journey,  
and I’m excited to keep building more along the way.
